# EastAsiaClimateExtremes

Initiative for Developing an East Asia Climate Extremes Dataset!

This repository provides historical data on climate extremes across the East Asia(EA) region, basically archiving the events of regular grid based climate extremes and weekly expectation of extreme events can be utilized as label dataset for developing AI-assisted models to predict anomalous temperature and rainfall events in East Asia. These efforts are part of the climate extreme prediction project led by the ART/APCC team (AI-based prediction Research and Technology at the APEC Climate Center). Currently, the repository focuses on extreme phenomena such as anomalously high temperatures(AHT_90), heavy rainfall(HR_90), and marine heatwaves(MHW_90), with the potential for further expansion. Additionally, it addresses fundamental statistics and characteristics of atmospheric and oceanic extremes. We hope this page will serve as a meaningful and practical starting point for researchers diving into studies on the dynamics and prediction of extreme phenomena.
