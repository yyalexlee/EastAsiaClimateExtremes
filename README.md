# EastAsiaClimateExtremes

This repository is for sharing the historical data of climate extremes over East Asia region for whom begining the extreme researches in terms of dynamics and prediction. The weekly statistics of grid-based extreme phenomena is processed as the labels in terms of developing the AI-assisted models to predict anomalous temperature and rainfall events over East Asia in association with the climate extreme prediction projection of the team ART/APCC (AI-based prediction Research and Technology/APEC Climate Center). Currently extreme phenomena are limited to anomalous hot temperature, heavy rainfall, and marine heat wave but can be expanded. The basic statistics/characteristic of atmospheric and oceanic extremes are addressed. We this page will guide the starting points of any purposed researches. 

This includes

data for common usage (currently unavailable due to GitHub's file size limit of 100MB)
codes of fucnctions for data processing
codes of ML/NN main architectures
and so forth.

why important? affecting human life (health and economics)

Definition of atmospheric and oceanic extreme phenomena 

1. Extreme Hot Temperature?
2. Extreme Rainfall
3. Marine Heat Waves over East Asia Marginal Seas

Spatial coverage/temporal range

Strengths/Limitations

**Example applications and good use of data**

### **Recommendations and considerations**

Data format 

if codes given: how to read the data and to isolate/plot timeseries of specific grid point?
