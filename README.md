# EastAsiaClimateExtremes

This repository provides historical data on climate extremes across the East Asia region, designed to support researchers beginning studies on the dynamics and prediction of extreme phenomena. Weekly statistics of grid-based extreme events are processed as labels for developing AI-assisted models to predict anomalous temperature and rainfall events in East Asia. These efforts are part of the climate extreme prediction project led by the ART/APCC team (AI-based prediction Research and Technology at the APEC Climate Center). Currently, the repository focuses on extreme phenomena such as anomalously high temperatures, heavy rainfall, and marine heatwaves, with the potential for further expansion. Additionally, it addresses fundamental statistics and characteristics of atmospheric and oceanic extremes. We hope this page will serve as a meaningful and practical starting point for researchers delving into related studies.


This can include
        data for common usage (currently unavailable due to GitHub's file size limit of 100MB)
        codes of fucnctions for data processing
        codes of ML/NN main architectures
        and so forth.
